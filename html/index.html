                                <p>Mr. Jobs, I would like to thank you for, indirectly, changing the way I used to act as I professional.
                                        Not only for being a user of almost all Apple's products, but for bringing to me the "keep it simple"
                                        way of life. I wish you peace in heaven near our Lord. And once again, thank you for everything you
                                        have done. I appreciate it a lot.

                                        variety of entertainment. You will be deeply missed. I also want to send my condolences to the family,
                                        who has lost a close loved one and one of the most coolest intellectual beings, us and the computer world

                                        I have been a devoted Apple consumer for 12 years and I really can't imagine anyone else
                                        doing what he has done in such a short period. I love Apple products, they inspire me 
                                        everyday andy life would certainly not be the same without them. Thank you for everything Steve.

                                <p>Apple, I express my deepest condolences to you for the unfortunate loss of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
                                I remember just the other day thinking about how I had an iPhone and that if it wasn't for Apple,
                                it seems like the basis of so many products like MP3 and revolutionary touch screen phones would not
                                exist in this day and time. I hope Apple and Steve Jobs both remember that there are so many people 
                                that love you and send our best wishes toward Apple and growing. I hope Steve's family can be mourned
                                with the thoughts of warming others surrounding them. I'm only 16 years old, but I hope the company of 
                                Apple prosper farther into many generations. Rest in peace Steve, you're a legend.

                                <p>I just wanted to pass on my condolences to the Jobs family, and to the Apple family as well. I remember my first experiences with the Apple IIe and IIgs in elementary school - Apple got me interested in computing. I was saddened when my school district went the PC route, but became a full convert upon taking a teaching position at a school that went against the norm and staked a claim as "The Apple school" in our district. I have truly enjoyed following the revolution Apple has brought on, and I will continue to be a supporter of all Steve and Apple have in store for the future. I never met Steve personally, but I will miss him nonetheless! Thank you for bringing this company and its wonderful products to the world.
